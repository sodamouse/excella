---------------------------------
Add filtering
Entries can now be filtered based on most of their attributes.
The previous name-only filtering has been renamed to `search` as it better describes the function.

Fix creating new entry while search / filter active would not focus the new entry correctly.

Add new type `u64`
This is a typedef to unsigned int and meant to replace size_t

Excella window is now maximized by default
